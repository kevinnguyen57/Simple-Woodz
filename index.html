      <p class = "intro-middle"> Hello visitor, this is a group project done with my peers during a Hackathon. This took much more work than probably needed considering that we did not have experience with html coding prior to the beginning of the event. We managed somehow though and we are proud of the outcome of this web page. Anyways, I hope you enjoy this simple webpage that we put our heart and soul into.</p>
